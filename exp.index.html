            <h2>how it works</h2>
            <p>The exploit works because of an issue CR50 chromebooks have when enrolling. If you reset it at just the right time, it will (some) corrupt data in the FWMP TPM space, resulting in an corrupted FWMP space. This allows us to boot into shimmer with <span class="highlight">CTRL + U</span> and to be able to clear FWMP when we fix the corrupted space.</p>

            <h2>how i found the exploit.</h2>
            <p>While trying to do CRSH2TTY, I ended up bricking my device multiple times (a total of four). One time, I randomly tried to disable write protection while unbricking with a SuzyQ, and surprisingly, it worked!<br>
            <small>All of my exploits have been made due to CRSH2TTY in some way.</small></p>

            <h2>requirements for this exploit</h2>
            <p>1. luck <br>
            2. a board that is pre-2021<br>
            as of 28/10/2024 (10/28/2024), if you have these boards listed below, you cannot do the exploit:<br>
            brya, brask, cherry, guybrush, skyrim, rex, nissa, corsola, staryu, geralt<br>
            <small>if your board is older than those, or you know it's a cr50 (NOT TI50) it will work</small><br>
            3. (PREFERABLY) access to <a href="chrome://network#logs">chrome://network#logs</a>

                <summary><b>[RECOMMENDED] For users with chrome://network#logs (can't be policy blocked, can't use oobescape)</b></summary>
                1. Go to the section below this one (finding the reset times), go through the process, and memorize the time it gives you, then continue <br>
                2. Powerwash and go through the regular setup until the "Getting device ready" screen.<br>
                3. Get a stopwatch ready and wait for the "Enterprise Enrollment" screen. <br>
                4. Wait until you're at the time the file uploader gave you, perform an EC-Reset by holding <span class="highlight">Refresh</span> and then clicking <span class="highlight">Power</span>.<br>
                5. Reboot (<span class="highlight">Refresh + Power</span>). If you're still in recovery mode, click TAB. If the recovery reason is not <span class="highlight">"Recovery Button Pressed"</span>, continue! Otherwise, retry until you get it.<br>
                6. Once bricked, get a <a href="https://dl.darkn.bio/SH1mmer/Prebuilt/Legacy">shim</a><br>
                7. Click <span class="highlight">CTRL + D</span>, once it reboots go into recovery mode <span class="highlight">ESC + Refresh + Power</span><br>
                8. Plug in your shim<br>
                9. When the shim boots and finishes loading type the letter <span class="highlight">D</span> and click enter to unenroll<br>
                10. Next, type <span class="highlight">B</span> to open a bash shell, this is where we'll unbrick<br>
                11. Type the following command <span class="highlight">gsctool -a -o</span><br>
                12. When it says to click <span class="highlight">PP</span> click the power button<br>
                13. Once you're at the end of that process you'll be unenrolled!<br>

                1. Powerwash and go through the regular setup until the "Getting device ready" screen.<br>
                2. Get a stopwatch ready and wait for the "Enterprise Enrollment" screen. <br>
                3. Record how long it took for enrollment to finish <br>
                4. Take the time it took, take around .5s-1s off, proceed <br>
                5. Go back to the "Enterprise Enrollment" screen, wait for the time from step 4, perform an EC-Reset by holding <span class="highlight">Refresh</span> and then clicking <span class="highlight">Power</span>.<br>
                6. If chrome turns back on and its in recovery mode, proceed, otherwise, keep trying (this may take ages but I did it 5 times before the better method was discovered)<br>
                7. Get a <a href="https://dl.darkn.bio/SH1mmer/Prebuilt/Legacy">shim</a><br>
                8. Click <span class="highlight">CTRL + D</span>, once it reboots go into recovery mode <span class="highlight">ESC + Refresh + Power</span><br>
                9. Plug in your shim<br>
                10. When the shim boots and finishes loading run these 3 commands: Deprovision, Disable Dev Block, Allow booting from usb
                11. Next, type <span class="highlight">B</span> to open a bash shell, this is where we'll unbrick<br>
                12. Type the following command <span class="highlight">gsctool -a -o</span><br>
                13. When it says to click <span class="highlight">PP</span> click the power button<br>
                14. Once you're at the end of that process you should reboot and you'll be unenrolled! if you're not, you're fucked<br>

                <summary><b>[EXPERIMENTAL] If <span class="highlight">gsctool</span> does not end up unbricking you - please read after reading steps.</b></summary>
                Sometimes gsctool seems to not work to open CCD, essentially fucking your device. Use these steps in case you want a Plan B or you currently need to use Plan B.<br>
                If you end up needing to use the backup firmware, your write protect needs to be off. When your BR1CKed, you can easily disable write protect the normal way (search up how to disable WP on your model for your chromebook. Usually, it just requires you to remove your battery but for dedede chromebooks it's different). Please do not try to do the Pencil method to disable WP since it's completely unnecessary in this case as FWMP does not exist.<br>
                1. Before starting BR1CK, create a backup of your firmware in SH1MMER.<br>
                2. Create a backup by running this command: <span class="highlight">flashrom -p internal -r backup.rom</span>, mount a regular storage USB and move/save your file to the mount.<br>
                3. [IF BR1CK FAILS] in a Linux environment, install <span class="highlight">flashrom</span>. Then, run <span class="highlight">wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheSpiritOfDark/gbbflags/main/gbb_utility && sudo ./set_gbb_flags.sh 0x80b1 backup.rom</span> with root permissions on the same direcotry that backup.rom is in.<br>
                4. Boot SH1mmer. Mount the USB with the modded backup. Run <span class="hightlight">sudo flashrom -p internal -w backup.rom</span> which will overwrite your current firmware with the modified one. This firmware will let you boot dev mode no matter what, essentially letting you unenroll the same way Pencil did. You should also be fully unbricked.<br>
            <br>
            If you didn't already make a backup before getting bricked, you have two options and neither of them are good.<br>
            You can either figure out how to work with a raw RMA shim's factory mode, or you use someone else's backup and change vital write protected info to your original chromebook's one after flashing the modded backup (note that you will need to disable write protect a second time after reflashing), probably with a factory shim or perhaps shimless RMA. This is a less documented procedure, and you will need to figure out how to replace these files. <span class="highlight">vpd -i RO_VPD -l</span> will give you your RO variables and you will also need to replace variables in <span class="highlight">crossystem</span>.
