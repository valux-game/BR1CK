            <h2>what even is BR1CK?</h2>
            <p>BR1CK was an exploit released October 27th, 2024. It is capable of unenrolling all devices with a Cr50 chip on the latest version, v130. It has a low chance of being patched without a release of a new Chromebook model.</p>
            <small>Scroll down to see if your device is compatible</small>
        </section>
        <section> 
            <h2>so, how does it work?</h2>
            <p>The exploit works because of an issue that these chromebooks have when enrolling. If you EC reset<sup>[1]</sup> <span class="highlight">↻+⏻</span> at just the right time, it will corrupt some data in the FWMP TPM space<sup>[2]</sup>, resulting in an unreadable FWMP, meaning we can unenroll since we aren't under it's control<sup>[3]</sup> (besides WP). This allows us to boot into sh1mmer, unenroll, and fix the brick with <span class="highlight">gsctool -a -o</span></p>
            <small>1. EC reset = the 2 keys used to forcefully restart the chromebook<br>2. FWMP TPM space = the data used by ChromeOS for enrollment related stuff<br>3. While FWMP is applied, protections are made to stop it from getting removed. These protections are from blocking debug cables to blocking resetting of the TPM (where it is stored)</small>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>how did you even find this?</h2>
            <p>While trying to do CRSH2TTY<sup>[1]</sup>, I ended up bricking my device multiple times (a total of four). One time, I randomly tried to disable write protection while unbricking with a SuzyQ (debug cable), and surprisingly, it worked! This led to the discovery that FWMP doesn't apply while FWMP is corrupted. This functionality is stored in the read-only firmware, which means Google would have to produce updated Chromebooks with the fix to stop this.<br>
            <small>All of my exploits have been made due to CRSH2TTY in some way.<br>1. CRSH2TTY was a (now patched) unenrollment exploit that required resetting at specific times, similar to BR1CK<br></small></p>

            <h2>what do i need to do this?</h2>
            <p>1. Luck (or skill, because you can get it consistently)<br>
            <details><summary>2. A board that is CR50 and not TI50 (click arrow for more information)</summary>
                As of October 29, 2024, if you have one of the boards listed below, you cannot do the exploit:<br>
                <i>brya, brask, cherry, guybrush, skyrim, rex, nissa, corsola, staryu, geralt</i><br>
                <span style="color:cyan">How do I find my board name?</span><br>
                <small id="boardname">Go to <a href="chrome://version">chrome://version</a>, click <span class="highlight">Ctrl + F</span> and search for "stable-channel" the word after that is your board</small><br>
            </details>
            3. (PREFERABLY) access to <a href="chrome://network#logs">chrome://network#logs</a><br>
            4. A leaked shim, a USB drive, and another pc to flash it
            4.1. if you have a keyrolled <span class="highlight">dedede</span> then you can buy a <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/335130747039">suzy qable (highly recommend this seller, bought from them and they're highly reputable)</a> and use alternative steps i can provide/walk you through

            <h2>how do i perform this exploit?</h2>
            <p>Backup anything that is not sync'd to your google account (mainly files)</p><p>It is a good idea to read these instructions on another device like a phone, you will not be able to access this guide on the chromebook you are using</p>
            <p><details style="line-height:2;font-size:18px;">
                <summary><b>[RECOMMENDED] For users with chrome://network#logs (can't be policy blocked, can't use oobescape)</b></summary>
                1. Go to the <a href="#timer">section below this one</a> (finding the reset times), go through the process, and memorize the time it gives you, then continue<br>
                2. Powerwash again by signing out, pressing Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R<br>
                3. Proceed through the setup, when "Getting device ready" pops up, get a stopwatch ready and wait for the next "Enterprise enrollment" screen. <br>
                4. When "Enterprise enrollment" pops up, start your stopwatch.<br>
                5. Wait until you're in the ranges of time (I would go for the higher end) the file uploader gave you, perform an EC-Reset by <span class="highlight">↻+⏻</span>.<br>
                6. If chrome turns back on and you get one of the following screens, proceed, otherwise, keep trying (this may take ages but most people can get it in 2-20 tries)<br><center>

                    <small>if you click tab on either of these, under recovery reason it should say something about an error in the TPM</small></center>
                7. Once bricked, get a <a href="https://dl.darkn.bio/SH1mmer/Prebuilt/Legacy">shim</a> (this guide will be using legacy)<br>
                <small>If you don't know your board name and still went on with these steps, you can look it up by entering the model name at the bottom on a site like <a href="https://cros.tech">cros.tech</a></small><br>
                8. Press <span class="highlight">CTRL + D</span>, then <span class="highlight">enter</span> to enable developer mode (It doesn't matter if it's blocked), and then <span class="highlight">ESC + ↻ + ⏻</span> to enter recovery mode.<br>
                9. Plug in your shim USB<br>
                <small>If you get a screen saying "the device does not contain ChromeOS"/"no valid image" you either chose the wrong shim for your board, didn't go into developer mode, bad flash, bad file, or you've been keyrolled (and cannot continue)</small><br>
                10. When the shim boots, type <span class="highlight">D</span> to select "Deprovision"<br>
                11. Next, type <span class="highlight">B</span> to open a bash shell, this is where we'll unbrick<br>
                12. Type the following command:<pre class="highlight">gsctool -a -o</pre>Press the power button whenever it spams "Press PP button now!" (this will take awhile) <small>whenever it says "Another press will be required" it is telling you to wait, you may have to wait for a minute or even more.</small><br>
                13. Once you're at the end of that process you should reboot and you'll be back at the "Welcome!" screen. (if you don't reboot/gsctool doesn't work, proceed to the bottom section, "errors while unbricking")<br>
                14. Get back into developer mode by pressing <span class="highlight">ESC + ↻ + ⏻</span>, then <span class="highlight">CTRL + D</span>, then <span class="highlight">enter</span>.<br> 
                15.

(keep this in mind if you want to stay in developer mode, you will have to do this each time you power it on)<br>
                16. You may get a "Your system is transitioning into Developer Mode" screen, wait for the 5 minute timer to finish, then follow step 15 again to boot into ChromeOS.<br>
                17. Start setting up your chromebook in OOBE by clicking <span class="highlight">Get Started</span>, going through WiFi, and continuing. You should enroll. <br>
                18. Enter VT2 <span class="highlight">ctrl + alt + →</span><br>
                19. In VT2 type the following command: <span class="highlight">vpd -i RW_VPD -s check_enrollment=0</span><br>
                20. Powerwash or return to secure mode and once you go back through OOBE setup you should be unenrolled! <small>if you arent contact byte (check the credits for where to contact) for help</small>
